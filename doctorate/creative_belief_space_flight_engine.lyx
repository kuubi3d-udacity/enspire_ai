This paper explores the application of underactuated planning and control
 approaches to the belief space planningproblem.
 Belief state dynamics are underactuated because the number of controlled
 dimensions (the parameters of a probability distribution) exceeds the number
 of independentcontrol inputs.
 As a result, the dynamics are constrained in a way that can make planning
 difficult.
 Our contribution is to recast the belief space planning problem in such
 away that conventional planning and control techniques areapplicable.
 As a result, we are able to find belief spacepolicies using linear quadratic
 regulation (LQR) and locally optimal belief space trajectories using direct
 transcription.
 We provide theoretical results characterizing the effectiveness of a plan-and-r
eplan strategy.
 Finally, we show that the approach produces interesting and relevant behaviors
 on a simple grasp problem where it is necessary to acquire information
 before acting.

US 2018 / 0311819 A1 Nov .
 1 , 2018[ 0157 ] The data association aware belief space planning ( DA
 - BSP ) approach relaxes the assumption that data - asso ciation is certain
 .
 In the passive approach with observations provided , DA - BSP results in
 a more robust inference .
 In the active approach whereby planning considers possible future observations
 .
 DA - BSP provides better action selection such that bad inferences and
 actions leading to ambiguities are avoided .
 DA - BSP is a more faithful representation of an aliased environment because
 the number of components can increase as well as decrease .
 f0158 ] It is to be understood that the following claims are intended to
 cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein
 described and all statements of the scope of the invention which , as a
 matter of language , might be said to fall there between What is claimed
 : 1 .
 A method implemented by a robot in a perceptually aliased environment ,
 wherein the robot comprises at least one sensor and a programmed task ,
 wherein performing the programmed task includes implementing one or more
 of a set of control actions , wherein the set of control actions includes
 a first control action , and wherein each control action changes a pose
 of the robot , the method comprising : inferring , from a scene observed
 by the sensor , while the robot is at a first pose , a probability distribution
 func tion ( pdf ) of the first pose , wherein the scene is one alias of
 a plurality of aliased scenes , such that the first pose pdf is a first
 mixture pdf , including a component pdf for each of the plurality of aliased
 scenes ; planning an optimal control action by : determining a second mixture
 pdf of a simulated pose of the robot , by simulating an application of
 the first control action to the first mixture pdf ; determining from the
 second mixture pdf a range of possible observations ; calculat ing scene
 probabilities for associating each possible observation with each aliased
 scene of a set of aliased 13 scenes ; calculating from the scene probabilities
 an objective function to determine an estimated cost of the first control
 action ; comparing the estimated cost of the first control action with
 estimated costs calculated for one or more additional control actions ,
 to determine an optimal control action , and executing the optimal control
 action to put the robot at a new pose .
 2 .
 The method of claim 1 , further comprising making a new observation from
 the new pose and determining , from the new observation , a new pdf of
 the new pose of the robot .
 3 .
 The method of claim 2 , wherein determining the new pdf comprises determining
 that an observed new scene is a singular scene having no aliases , resulting
 in disambiguation such that the new pdf includes only one pdf component
 corresponding to the singular scene .
 4 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein calculating the objec tive function from
 the scene probabilities comprises calcu lating from the scene probabilities
 , for each possible obser vation of the range of possible observations
 a likelihood weight , and applying the likelihood weight to the objective
 function .
 5 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein calculating the objec tive function comprises
 integrating a product of two factors over all observations in the range
 of possible observations , wherein a first factor represents a likelihood
 of a given observation , given a history of actions and the first control
 action , and wherein the second factor corresponds to a probability of
 the second mixture pdf , given the history and the given observation .
 6 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein the possible observa tions are generated
 by sampling viewpoints from the second mixed pdf and associating the sampled
 viewpoints with respective observed scenes according to a mapping of the
 environment .
 7 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein the simulated obser vations , made from
 the possible poses , are determined by a predefined event likelihood relationsh
ip .
 8 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein the cost function is based on a Kullback
 - Leibler ( KL ) divergence with respect to the likelihood weights .
 9 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein the planning is a multi - stage planning
 process , wherein the second mixture pdf is generated by simulating a sequence
 of control actions , and wherein the optimal control action is the control
 action initiating an optimal sequence of control actions .
 10 .
 The method of claim 1 , wherein the scene probabili ties are pruned by
 comparing each scene probability with a predefined weight threshold , to
 remove scene probabilities having negligible probabilities .
 11 .
 A robotic system for navigating a perceptually aliased environment , comprising
 a robot having at least one sensor and a programmed task , wherein performing
 the pro grammed task includes implementing one or more of a set of control
 actions , wherein the set of control actions includes a first control action
 , and wherein each control action changes a pose of the robot , wherein
 the robot includes a processor and a memory with instructions that when
 executed by the processor cause the robot to perform the steps of : inferring
 , from a scene observed by the sensor , while the robot is at a first pose
 , a probability distribution func tion ( pdf ) of the first pose , wherein
 the scene is one alias of a plurality of aliased scenes , such that the
 first pose pdf is a first mixture pdf , including a component pdf for each
 of the plurality of aliased scenes ; planning an optimal control action
 by : determining a second mixture pdf of a simulated pose of the robot
 by simulating an application of the first control action to the first mixture
 pdf ; determining from the second mixture pdf a range of possible observations
 ; calculat ing scene probabilities for associating each possible observation
 with each aliased scene of a set of aliased scenes ; calculating from the
 scene probabilities an objective function to determine an estimated cost
 of the first control action ; comparing the estimated cost of the first
 control action with estimated costs calculated for one or more additional
 control actions to determine an optimal control action ; and executing
 the optimal control action to put the robot at a new pose .
